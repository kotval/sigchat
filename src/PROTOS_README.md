signalservice.rs was generated by running ./update_signalservice.sh. This is prefered over prost-build since proto files don't change much and code generation decreases ergonomics and introduces additional build dependencies (protoc), which are unnecessary unless a change does occur. I did this because using prost-build gave me horribleerros which I found difficult to debug. This is also more similar to how 

These .protos have been copied from https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/tree/main/protos, which seems to be the most up to date. To avoid bloat, I will be copying them in one by one as needed.
