# Note:
signalservice.rs was generated by running ./update_signalservice.sh. 

This is prefered over prost-build since proto files don't change much and code generation decreases ergonomics and 
introduces additional build dependencies (protoc), which are unnecessary unless a change does occur. 
I did this because using prost-build gave me horrible erros which I found difficult to debug.

This is also more similar to how pb-rs works, but we can't use that due to one of our Protobufs using `optional`, which quick-protobufs
does not support. I am not sure if it really matters, but until we have things set up enough to test, I am prefering just getting
things working. 

These .protos have been copied from https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/tree/main/libsignal-service/protobuf, including
their script to sync from upstream.
